## :dart: About ##

  This project simulates some of the most basics transactions on a bank application. In this project I am using as Database the service of [MongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) wich is a Database cloud service. I defined a [DAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer) that give us the flexibility to change make change on our Database backend with mininum effort and separated from the application. 
  
  The frontend is created with HTML, Bottstrap as CSS library and ReactJS, so fields are validated and transactions affects the balance, the user can not wihdraw more than the balance in the account, passords are validated to be more than 8 characters, amounts fields can not be negatives or other characters than numbers. Any user can create accouts, and make its own transactactios and see these as well.
  
  The backend was built running NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and using Router middleware. During the coding process, I worked with local Database, MongoDB and using the ODM Mongoose, to helpe me with the test of API routes and Database access I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as a client for testing.
  
  An authentication layer is working using the service of authentication service of Google [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The application authenticate with user and password, but you can authenticate with your Google account also.
  
  To deploy the appllcation, I used the service of [Render.Com](https://render.com/), this site allows developers to deploy web applications really fast and easy. You connect your Render project to your Github, select your repository and start your deploy. Once you have deployed the application, if you make change to your code and it is updated in your Github repo, automatically Render identifies the change and run a new deployment with changes you included.
